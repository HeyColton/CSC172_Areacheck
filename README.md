# CSC172_Areacheck
My Project3 has four classes and one test file folder.

Line and Point are classes to specify the features of line and point.

MyTreeNode contains insert method and some other methods work together to input lines.

BinarySearchTree is my main program, and main method to test it is at the bottom of the class. Copy the content of one test file like those in “in” folder to console, then you can get results. (It is necessary to click enter after you input all pairs of points so that nextLine() can read in the last pair of points.) PointLocation method executes commands that build a binarysearchtree from lines input and read in some pairs of points to test it. MouseListener can help us to choose pairs of points on panel and my program will check if they are in the same area. Areacheck method is to test if two points are in the same area. findexternal method can compute the number of external nodes. path and find path are combined to compute paths of external nodes. 

In is a file folders you can use to test my program.

I did extra credits. If you run my main method at the bottom of BinarySearchTree, you can see one GUI will be popped out. Click one first point, and then click the second point. The result that if they are in the same region will be shown in the console. MOREOVER, I THINK THIS DRAWING PART IS WORTH AT LEAST 20 POINTS!

Have a nice day!
